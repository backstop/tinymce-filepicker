Altered specifically for Backstop. 
-------------

The changes probably won't be useful to anyone else, as we mostly remove functionality and fire an event which we pick up elsewhere.  But if you want it, have at it.


tinymce-filepicker
==================

Filepicker plugin for TinyMCE editor.


Installation
------------

Copy filepicker directory in this repository to TinyMCE's plugins directory.


Live Demo
---------

Click on 'Claim This Shop' (it's just a demo =) it's okay to claim it) button and you'll see TinyMCE editor in the customize page. You'll see the Filepicker icon on the editor's menu bar besides the unlink icon. Enjoy playing with the editor!
